# qb-redzone

First i want to give credits to https://github.com/XenoS-ITA he made this script and i added on to it to provide more features for people thats playing in the redzones and made sure this supported QBCore. 

-I've added compatibility with qb-core so that when someone dies in this redzone, the person will be respawned at the points made in the "config.lua".

-I fixed a issue where people would have infinite ammo if they exit the redzone and the option in "config.lua" is set to true.

-I added a respawn timer so the person that dies doesnt get revived immediately after dying (would recommend setting to 5secs or more)

-I also made it to where when the person enter the redzone it gives the person a gun of choice thats inputed im the "config.lua".
